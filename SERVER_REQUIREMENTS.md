# RizzPay Server Requirements and Deployment Guide

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Server Requirements
- **Web Server**: Node.js-compatible server environment (minimum v16.x)
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended for production)
- **CPU**: 2+ cores (4+ cores recommended for production)
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD minimum (faster I/O improves transaction processing)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (via Supabase)
- **Network**: HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- **Bandwidth**: Minimum 100 Mbps for reliable payment processing

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling capabilities for handling payment spikes
- Load balancing for distributed transaction processing
- Database connection pooling for improved performance

## Transaction Processing Architecture

### Payment Inbound Flow
1. **Payment Initiation**:
   - Customer initiates payment via UI
   - System validates request parameters and amount
   - Transaction record created with "pending" status
   - Unique transaction ID generated

2. **Payment Gateway Integration**:
   - Request routed to appropriate payment processor (Razorpay, etc.)
   - Metadata and customer information securely passed to gateway
   - Gateway presents payment interface to customer

3. **Payment Authorization**:
   - Gateway handles payment method verification and authorization
   - Authorization tokens/responses captured
   - Transaction updated with processing state

4. **Payment Confirmation**:
   - Gateway callback confirms payment status
   - Webhook endpoint receives confirmation
   - Transaction status updated to "successful" or "failed"
   - Customer notified of payment outcome

### Payment Storage Architecture
1. **Database Transaction Records**:
   - All transactions stored in PostgreSQL via Supabase
   - Transaction table with comprehensive metadata
   - Processing timeline stored for audit purposes
   - Payment details encrypted when necessary

2. **Security Measures**:
   - PCI-DSS compliance considerations for card data
   - Tokenization of sensitive payment information
   - Row-level security policies in database
   - Data encryption for sensitive fields

3. **Reconciliation System**:
   - Daily transaction reconciliation with payment gateways
   - Automated detection of discrepancies
   - Settlement verification process

### Payment Outbound Flow
1. **Withdrawal Request Processing**:
   - Merchant/customer initiates withdrawal request
   - System validates available balance
   - Withdrawal transaction record created

2. **Bank Transfer Integration**:
   - NEFT/IMPS/UPI payment initiated to recipient bank
   - Integration with banking APIs (HDFC, etc.)
   - Callback handling for transfer confirmation

3. **Settlement Processing**:
   - Batched settlement for optimal processing fees
   - Settlement record maintenance
   - Reconciliation with bank records

## Deployment Guide

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Configure production environment variables
   nano .env.production
   ```

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Execute Supabase migration scripts for schema creation
   - Set up database backup procedures
   - Configure RLS policies for production

3. **Application Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Build production bundle
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to server
   # Option 1: Direct server deployment
   rsync -avz --delete dist/ user@your-server:/path/to/deployment/
   
   # Option 2: Docker deployment
   docker build -t rizzpay:latest .
   docker push rizzpay:latest
   ```

4. **SSL Configuration**:
   - Obtain SSL certificate from trusted provider
   - Configure web server for HTTPS
   - Set up auto-renewal for certificates

### Security Hardening

1. **Server Hardening**:
   - Implement firewall rules (allow only necessary ports)
   - Configure fail2ban for brute force protection
   - Regular security patching and updates

2. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting on all payment endpoints
   - IP-based restrictions for administrative functions
   - CORS policy implementation
   - JWT token validation and expiration

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Transaction log aggregation
   - Real-time error alerting
   - Performance monitoring
   - Regular security audits

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **PCI-DSS**: For handling card payment information
- **RBI Guidelines**: For payment processing in India
- **KYC/AML**: Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks
- **GDPR/Data Protection**: For handling customer personal information

### Audit Requirements
- Transaction audit trails
- Administrator action logging
- Regular security assessments
- Data retention policies

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Procedures**:
   - Daily database backups
   - Transaction log backups every 6 hours
   - Offsite backup storage

2. **Recovery Plan**:
   - Database restoration procedures
   - Application redeployment automation
   - Failover mechanisms for high availability

3. **Business Continuity**:
   - Redundant payment processing capabilities
   - Multi-region deployment options
   - Regular disaster recovery testing

## Maintenance and Updates

1. **Scheduled Maintenance**:
   - Regular database optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - Security patch application

2. **Update Procedures**:
   - Staged deployment process
   - Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
   - Rollback procedures for failed updates

## Performance Benchmarks

- Transaction processing: <500ms average response time
- Payment gateway integration: <2s completion time
- Webhook processing: <200ms processing time
- API response time: <100ms for non-transactional endpoints
- Maximum concurrent transactions: Scaled based on server resources

## Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Key Metrics to Monitor**:
   - Transaction success/failure rates
   - API response times
   - Database performance
   - Payment gateway availability
   - Error rates and types

2. **Alert Configuration**:
   - Critical alerts for payment failures
   - Performance degradation alerts
   - Security breach notifications
   - Gateway integration failures
