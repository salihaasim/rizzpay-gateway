# RizzPay Production Security Implementation

## Security Architecture Overview

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy
- Multiple security layers for comprehensive protection
- Principle of least privilege across all systems
- Regular independent security audits
- Proactive threat hunting and monitoring

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with custom rules
- Network level firewall with default-deny posture
- API gateway with request validation
- DDoS protection services

### VPC Architecture
- Private subnets for application and database servers
- Public subnets only for load balancers
- Network ACLs complementing security groups
- VPN for administrative access

## Application Security

### Code Security
- Static application security testing (SAST) in CI pipeline
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) before deployment
- Software composition analysis (SCA) for dependency scanning
- Regular penetration testing by certified testers

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication for all admin access
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for frontend authentication
- Fine-grained permission model for access control
- Secure session management with timeout and rotation

## Data Security

### Encryption Strategy
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Field-level encryption for PII and financial data
- Database TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)

### Key Management
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) for cryptographic operations
- Automated key rotation schedule
- Separation of duties for key management
- Backup procedures for cryptographic materials

## Fraud Prevention

### Transaction Monitoring
- Real-time fraud scoring for transactions
- Velocity checks for unusual activity
- Device fingerprinting for risk assessment
- IP reputation analysis and geolocation verification

### Behavioral Analysis
- User behavior analytics for anomaly detection
- Machine learning models for fraud pattern recognition
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force and enumeration attacks
- Notification system for suspicious activities

## Incident Response

### IR Team Structure
- Dedicated incident response team with defined roles
- On-call rotation for 24/7 coverage
- Communication protocols for different severity levels
- Coordination procedures with payment partners

### Response Procedures
- Detailed playbooks for common incident types
- Evidence collection and preservation guidelines
- Post-incident analysis process
- Continuous improvement cycle

## Compliance Documentation

### Audit Trail
- Immutable logs for all security-relevant events
- Centralized log management with retention policies
- Log correlation for security event detection
- Regular log review procedures

### Certification Maintenance
- PCI DSS compliance monitoring
- RBI regulatory compliance documentation
- ISO 27001 controls implementation
- GDPR data protection measures
