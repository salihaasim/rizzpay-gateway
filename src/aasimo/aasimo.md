## Technical Implementation

Aasimo AI is implemented as a React component with a chat-like interface. It currently uses a pre-defined set of responses that are randomly selected based on user queries. In future iterations, it could be connected to a more sophisticated AI backend.

## Access Instructions

Aasimo AI is accessible only through a direct URL:
- **URL**: `/aasimo-ai`

- The URL can be shared with authorized team members who need access to the tool

2. Consider the AI's suggestions as starting points for further development
3. Always evaluate suggestions for feasibility, security implications, and alignment with business goals
4. Document valuable ideas generated through the AI for future development planning

## Future Development Plans

## Security Considerations

- Access to Aasimo AI should be restricted to authorized personnel only
