# RizzPay Production Deployment Strategy

## Deployment Environments

### Environment Hierarchy
1. **Development** - For feature development and unit testing
2. **Integration** - For integration testing between components
3. **Staging** - Production-like environment for final testing
4. **Production** - Live customer-facing environment
5. **DR** - Disaster recovery environment in alternate region

### Environment Parity
- Identical configuration across environments
- Infrastructure-as-Code for environment definition
- Containerization to ensure consistency
- Configuration management database for tracking differences

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Process
- Automated builds triggered by code commits
- Separate build artifacts for frontend and backend
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Static code analysis and security scanning

### Deployment Automation
- Blue/Green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for high-risk changes
- Automated rollback capability
- Feature flags for controlled feature rollout

## Release Management

### Release Cadence
- Regular releases every 2 weeks
- Critical security patches as needed
- Scheduled maintenance windows for major updates
- Blackout periods during high-volume business seasons

### Change Control
- Formal change request process
- Change Advisory Board review for significant changes
- Risk assessment for each deployment
- Post-implementation verification procedures

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Transaction performance metrics
- Server resource utilization
- API endpoint response times
- Database query performance

### Alerting Strategy
- Multi-level alerting based on severity
- Alert aggregation to prevent alert fatigue
- On-call rotation with escalation paths
- Automated incident ticketing

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling groups for application servers
- Scale based on CPU utilization and request queue depth
- Minimum 3 instances per service for redundancy
- Geographic distribution for global availability

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for scaling read operations
- Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Query optimization for high-volume operations
- Database sharding for very large datasets

## Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback
- Version control for all configuration
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Data backup points before major changes
- Service version rollback procedures

### Manual Intervention
- Emergency access procedures
- Break-glass accounts for critical situations
- Runbooks for common failure scenarios
- Command reference for quick recovery actions

## Documentation Requirements

### Deployment Documentation
- Architecture diagrams
- Network topology
- Security controls
- Data flow diagrams

### Operational Documentation
- Runbooks for common procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- Escalation procedures
- Vendor contact information
