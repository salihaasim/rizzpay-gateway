## Transaction Processing Architecture

### Payment Inbound Flow
1. **Payment Initiation**:
   - Customer initiates payment via UI
   - System validates request parameters and amount
   - Transaction record created with "pending" status
   - Unique transaction ID generated

2. **Payment Gateway Integration**:
   - Request routed to appropriate payment processor (Razorpay, etc.)
   - Metadata and customer information securely passed to gateway
   - Gateway presents payment interface to customer

3. **Payment Authorization**:
   - Gateway handles payment method verification and authorization
   - Authorization tokens/responses captured
   - Transaction updated with processing state

4. **Payment Confirmation**:
   - Gateway callback confirms payment status
   - Webhook endpoint receives confirmation
   - Transaction status updated to "successful" or "failed"
   - Customer notified of payment outcome

### Payment Storage Architecture
1. **Database Transaction Records**:
   - All transactions stored in PostgreSQL via Supabase
   - Transaction table with comprehensive metadata
   - Processing timeline stored for audit purposes
   - Payment details encrypted when necessary

2. **Long-Term Transaction Storage**:
   - 7-year retention of all transaction logs as per regulatory requirements
   - Data partitioning by year/month for efficient retrieval
   - Automatic archiving system for transactions older than 1 year
   - Tamper-proof storage with blockchain verification for regulatory compliance
   - Regular integrity checks and audit trails of archived data

3. **Security Measures**:
   - PCI-DSS compliance considerations for card data
   - Tokenization of sensitive payment information
   - Row-level security policies in database
   - Data encryption for sensitive fields

4. **Reconciliation System**:
   - Daily transaction reconciliation with payment gateways
   - Automated detection of discrepancies
   - Settlement verification process

### Payment Outbound Flow
1. **Withdrawal Request Processing**:
   - Merchant/customer initiates withdrawal request
   - System validates available balance
   - Withdrawal transaction record created

2. **Bank Transfer Integration**:
   - NEFT/IMPS/UPI payment initiated to recipient bank
   - Integration with banking APIs (HDFC, etc.)
   - Callback handling for transfer confirmation

3. **Settlement Processing**:
   - Batched settlement for optimal processing fees
   - Settlement record maintenance
   - Reconciliation with bank records

## Deployment Guide

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Configure production environment variables
   nano .env.production
   ```

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Execute Supabase migration scripts for schema creation
   - Set up database backup procedures
   - Configure RLS policies for production

3. **Application Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Build production bundle
   npm run build

   docker build -t rizzpay:latest .
   docker push rizzpay:latest
   ```

4. **SSL Configuration**:
   - Obtain SSL certificate from trusted provider
   - Configure web server for HTTPS

   - Transaction log aggregation
   - Real-time error alerting
   - Performance monitoring
   - Regular security audits

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **PCI-DSS**: For handling card payment information
