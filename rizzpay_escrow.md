# RizzPay Escrow System

## Overview

The RizzPay Escrow System is a secure financial mechanism that facilitates trusted transactions between merchants and customers on our platform. It acts as a neutral third party to hold funds until all transaction conditions are met, protecting both buyers and sellers from fraud or non-fulfillment of services.

## How RizzPay Escrow Works

1. **Deposit Phase**: 
   - Customer initiates payment through RizzPay
   - Funds are securely held in the RizzPay Escrow Account
   - Neither the merchant nor the customer can access these funds during this phase
   - Customer receives confirmation of fund reservation

2. **Verification Phase**:
   - Merchant delivers goods or services as agreed
   - Customer verifies receipt and quality of goods/services
   - RizzPay provides a verification portal for both parties
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms are available if needed

3. **Release Phase**:
   - Upon verification, funds are released to the merchant
   - RizzPay deducts platform fees (typically 1-2%)
   - Transaction records are maintained for compliance and audit purposes
   - Both parties receive final transaction confirmation
