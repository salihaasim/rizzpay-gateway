## Implementation Checklist

Before proceeding with production deployment, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- [ ] Complete security audit and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Finalize database schema and migration plan
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Prepare disaster recovery and business continuity plans
- [ ] Complete PCI DSS compliance self-assessment
- [ ] Implement data retention and archival policy
- [ ] Prepare operational runbooks for common scenarios
- [ ] Train support and operations teams

## Deployment Process

The recommended deployment process follows these high-level steps:

1. Deploy infrastructure using Infrastructure-as-Code templates
2. Configure networking and security groups
3. Deploy database clusters with replication
4. Deploy application servers with blue/green strategy
5. Configure monitoring and alerting
6. Perform security verification and penetration testing
7. Conduct load testing under production-like conditions
8. Migrate production data (if applicable)
9. Switch DNS and go live
10. Monitor closely during initial operation period
