# RizzPay Production Database Setup

## Database Architecture

### Primary Database
- PostgreSQL 14+ with high availability setup
- Multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover
- Read replicas for reporting and analytics queries
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

### Sharding Strategy
- Transaction data sharded by date and merchant ID
- Separate database instances for high-volume merchants
- Archival database for transactions older than 2 years

### Database Sizing
- Initial capacity: 2TB fast SSD storage
- Growth planning: 500GB additional storage per month
- Total capacity planning: 7+ years of transaction data

## Data Models Optimization

### Indexing Strategy
- B-tree indexes on frequently queried fields
- Partial indexes for status-based queries
- GIN indexes for JSON/JSONB fields containing transaction metadata

### Query Optimization
- Materialized views for reporting dashboards
- Stored procedures for complex transaction operations
- Query plan optimization and regular VACUUM scheduling

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Hourly incremental backups
- Daily full backups
- 30-day backup retention
- Off-site backup storage in different geographical region

### Disaster Recovery Plan
- Maximum 1 hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Maximum 4 hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Regular disaster recovery testing schedule
- Documented recovery procedures with assigned responsibilities

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Management
- Minimum 100 connections per app server
- Connection pooling with idle timeout of 10 minutes
- Maximum 500 connections per database instance

### Transaction Handling
- Read-committed isolation level for most transactions
- Serializable isolation level for financial reconciliation operations
- Careful management of long-running transactions

## Security Requirements

### Access Control
- Role-based access control for database users
- Read-only roles for reporting and monitoring users
- Row-level security for merchant data isolation

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive audit logs for schema changes
- Transaction logging for sensitive operations
- Regular audit log review procedures

## Maintenance Plan

- Weekly maintenance window (low-traffic period)
- Index reorganization schedule
- Statistics update frequency
- Version upgrade evaluation process
