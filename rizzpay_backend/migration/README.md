# RizzPay Migration Strategy: Lovable → AWS Production

## Overview
This directory contains the migration strategy and tools to move RizzPay from Lovable/Supabase to a full AWS production environment with Test, UAT, and Prod environments.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Database Migration (Current)
- Export Supabase schema and data
- Set up AWS RDS PostgreSQL instances
- Migrate database structure and data
- Validate data integrity

### Phase 2: Application Migration
- Containerize React frontend and Node.js backend
- Set up AWS infrastructure (ECS, S3, CloudFront)
- Configure environment-specific settings

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- Implement automated testing
- Deploy to Test → UAT → Prod environments

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Operations
- Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- Configure alerting and logging
- Implement backup strategies
