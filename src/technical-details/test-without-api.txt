7. How to Test:
   a. Visit /payment or click "Make Payment" from homepage
   b. Enter any amount
   c. Choose payment method
   d. Use test credentials from above
   e. Observe the transaction flow and notifications
   f. Check transaction history for records

8. Test Scenarios:
   - Regular payment flow
   - Payment failures and error handling
   - Wallet transfers between users
   - Transaction history and receipt generation

Note: All transactions are simulated and no real API calls are made to payment gateways.
This is purely for testing the UI/UX flow and frontend functionality.
