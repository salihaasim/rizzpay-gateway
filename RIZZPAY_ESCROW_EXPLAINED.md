## Introduction to RizzPay Escrow

RizzPay's escrow system serves as a trusted third-party intermediary that holds funds during transactions between two parties (typically a buyer and a seller). This ensures that funds are only released when all agreed-upon conditions are met, providing security and trust for both parties.

### Key Benefits

- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects buyers from fraudulent sellers and sellers from non-paying buyers
- **Trust Facilitation**: Creates confidence in transactions between parties who may not know each other
- **Dispute Resolution**: Provides a structured process for handling disagreements
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures all transactions adhere to applicable financial regulations
- **Transparent Process**: All parties can track the status of funds throughout the transaction

## How Escrow Works

RizzPay's escrow system follows a structured workflow:

### 1. Transaction Initiation

- Buyer initiates a payment through a merchant integrated with RizzPay
- RizzPay generates a secure payment link or checkout session
- Payment details are recorded in the escrow system

### 2. Fund Collection

- Buyer submits payment via their preferred method (UPI, card, netbanking, etc.)
- Funds are deposited directly into RizzPay's secure escrow account
- Both buyer and merchant receive confirmation of funds receipt

### 3. Holding Period

- Funds remain in the escrow account during a predetermined holding period
- For standard transactions: 24-72 hours
- For high-value transactions: up to 7 business days
- For subscription services: until the trial period expires

### 4. Verification Process

- Merchant confirms the delivery of goods or services
- Buyer may be required to confirm receipt or satisfaction
- Automatic verification occurs after the holding period if no disputes are raised

### 5. Fund Release

- Upon successful verification, funds are released to the merchant
- Release can be automatic (time-based) or manual (confirmation-based)
- Settlement occurs via bank transfer to the merchant's registered account

### 6. Transaction Closure

- All parties receive final transaction confirmation
- Complete audit trail is maintained for compliance purposes
- Transaction data is archived securely

## Bank API Integration

RizzPay's escrow system integrates with multiple banking APIs to facilitate seamless fund movement while maintaining robust security standards.
