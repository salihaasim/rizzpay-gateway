- **Withdraw via Bank Transfer** (1% fee)
- **No chargebacks** (All transactions are final)

### Merchant & User Platform
- **Web Dashboard** (For merchants to manage transactions)
- **Mobile App** (For transaction tracking)
- **API Integration** (For website payment processing)

### Integration Methods
- **Hosted Payment Page** (Redirection for payments)
- **Direct API Integration** (Merchants connect via API)
- **Embedded Payment Widget** (For seamless on-site payments)

### Authentication & Access
- **Username + Password Login**
- **Google/Apple Social Login**
- **No OTP & No 2FA**

### Security Features
- **Encrypted Transactions** (Ensuring data security)
- **IP & Device Tracking** (Detecting suspicious logins)
- **Anti-Fraud Monitoring** (Preventing fraudulent activities)
- **Automatic Fund Freezing** (For suspicious transactions)

### Merchant Onboarding
- **Manual Approval** (Admin verifies every merchant before activation)

### Settlement & Tracking
- **Auto-Detect Deposits** (Matching payments with merchant accounts)
- **Generate Payment Receipts** (Confirming successful transactions)

### Customer Support
- **Telegram Support**
- **WhatsApp Support**
- **No live chat, email, or ticket system**

### Hosting & Infrastructure
- **Cloud Hosting (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean)** (For scalability)
- **Self-Hosted VPS** (For greater control)
- **Physical Server** (For local security)
- **Hybrid Setup** (Mixing all three for redundancy)

## Technical Stack Recommendations
### Frontend
- **React (Next.js) or Vue.js** (For web dashboard & embedded widget)
- **React Native or Flutter** (For mobile app development)

### Backend
- **Node.js (Express/Nest.js) or Python (FastAPI/Django)** (For API services)
- **Supabase or Firebase** (For authentication & data storage)
- **PostgreSQL or MySQL** (For transaction management)

### Payment Processing
- **Razorpay (For legal INR payments)**
- **Custom UPI/NEFT Handling** (To avoid betting-related restrictions)

## Compliance & Legal Strategy
- **Stay below radar** (Avoid large transactions and use neutral transaction names)
- **Multiple Payment Gateways** (To prevent dependency on a single provider)
- **Transaction Splitting** (Breaking large payments into smaller amounts)
- **No KYC Required** (For easy onboarding & anonymity)

## Development Phases & Milestones
### Phase 1: MVP Development (1-2 months)
- Set up backend API & database
- Develop Web Dashboard (Merchant Panel)
- Integrate UPI & Bank Transfer Payments
- Implement basic security features

### Phase 2: Expansion (3-4 months)
