```

## Database Schema

The database is structured with the following key tables:

1. **Users/Merchants**
   - Authentication data
   - Merchant profiles and settings
   - KYC information

2. **Transactions**
   - Transaction records
   - Payment status tracking
   - Financial details

3. **Webhooks**
   - Webhook configurations
   - Delivery status
   - Event logs

4. **Wallets**
   - Balance information
   - Transaction history
   - Transfer records

## Security Implementation

1. **Data Encryption**
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - AES-256 for sensitive stored data
   - Tokenization for payment information

2. **Authentication Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management and timeout

3. **Transaction Security**
   - Digital signatures for transactions
   - Real-time fraud detection
   - Transaction limits and controls

## Scalability Design

The system is designed for horizontal scalability:

1. **Stateless Components**
   - All components are designed to be stateless
   - Session state is maintained in distributed caches

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Read replicas for high-read operations
   - Vertical scaling for write operations
   - Partitioning strategy for large datasets

3. **Load Management**
   - Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Queue-based processing for high loads

## Monitoring and Reliability

1. **System Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - Resource utilization tracking
