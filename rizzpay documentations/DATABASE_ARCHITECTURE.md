# RizzPay Database Architecture

## Overview

RizzPay's database architecture is designed to handle high-volume financial transactions with strict data integrity, compliance requirements, and audit capabilities. This document outlines our approach to database design and management.

## Core Database Structure

### 1. Multi-Ledger System

RizzPay employs a multi-ledger approach to transaction management:

- **Transaction Ledger**: Immutable record of all transactions
- **Balance Ledger**: Current account balances and state
- **Settlement Ledger**: Record of funds movement between accounts
- **Reconciliation Ledger**: Verification and matching of transactions

This separation ensures data integrity while allowing for efficient querying and reporting.

## Data Storage Strategy

### PostgreSQL as Primary Database

- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures transaction integrity
- **Row-Level Security**: Fine-grained access control
- **JSON Support**: Flexible schema for metadata

### Partitioning Strategy

- **Time-Based Partitioning**: Transaction tables are partitioned by month
- **Merchant-Based Partitioning**: For high-volume merchants
- **Archival Strategy**: Older transactions move to cold storage

## Transaction Data Flow

1. **Transaction Initiation**:
   - Transaction is recorded in pending state
   - Entry created in Transaction Ledger

2. **Processing Stage**:
   - Processing events recorded with timestamps
   - State changes tracked in Transaction table

3. **Settlement Stage**:
   - Settlement Ledger updated
   - Balance Ledger adjusted
   - Final transaction state recorded

4. **Reconciliation**:
   - Periodic matching of internal records with bank statements
   - Discrepancies flagged for review

## Critical Tables

### Merchants Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE merchants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  company VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Transactions Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  merchant_id UUID REFERENCES merchants(id),
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'INR',
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  customer_email VARCHAR(255),
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Balance Ledger Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE balance_ledger (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  merchant_id UUID REFERENCES merchants(id),
  balance_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Settlement Ledger Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE settlement_ledger (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  merchant_id UUID REFERENCES merchants(id),
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  settlement_batch_id UUID,
  utr_number VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Data Consistency Measures

1. **Double-Entry Accounting**:
   - Every transaction affects at least two ledger entries
   - Total debits must equal total credits

2. **Consistency Checks**:
   - Periodic verification of ledger balances
   - Automated reconciliation processes

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All data modifications are logged
   - Historical transaction states preserved

## Database Performance Optimization

1. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Composite indices for common queries
   - Partial indices for filtered queries

2. **Caching Layer**:
   - Redis used for high-frequency balance checks
   - In-memory caching for active merchants

3. **Read Replicas**:
   - Analytics and reporting use read replicas
   - Master database reserved for write operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Sensitive data encrypted at rest
   - PCI-DSS compliant storage

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Row-level security policies

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - All database operations logged
   - Regular audit reviews

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Schedule**:
   - Full daily backups
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Transaction log shipping

2. **Recovery Strategy**:
   - Multiple regional replicas
   - Automated failover procedures
   - Regular recovery testing

## Scaling Strategy

As transaction volume grows, our database architecture can scale through:

1. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Increased resources for database servers
   - Optimized query performance

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Read replicas for reporting workloads
   - Sharding by merchant for write operations

3. **Microservice Database Strategy**:
   - Service-specific databases for specialized workloads
   - Shared ledger system for financial consistency

## Conclusion

RizzPay's database architecture prioritizes financial accuracy, security, and performance. The multi-ledger approach ensures we maintain complete audit trails while providing fast and reliable service to our merchants and their customers.
