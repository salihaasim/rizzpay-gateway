RizzPay Test Instructions (Without External API Integration)

Transaction Handling Capacity Simulation:

1. Simulated Transaction Limits:
   - Per Single Transaction: ₹50,000 
   - Daily Transaction Total: ₹5,00,000
   - Monthly Transaction Total: ₹25,00,000

2. Capacity Simulation Rules:
   - 80% of transactions will process successfully
   - 20% will trigger simulated failure scenarios
   - All transactions are stored in local memory
   - Transactions persist until page refresh

3. Detailed Transaction Handling:
   - Max Concurrent Transactions: 10
   - Transaction Queue Management: First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
   - Simulated Processing Time: 2-3 seconds per transaction
   - Random failure injection for testing resilience

4. Transaction State Management:
   - Initiated
   - Processing
   - Completed
   - Failed
   - Refunded (simulated)

5. Limitations in Simulation:
   - No actual money movement
   - No real bank integration
   - Stateless transaction storage
   - No persistent transaction history

Note: These limits are for testing UI/UX flow and frontend functionality only. 
Actual production systems will have different transaction handling capabilities.
