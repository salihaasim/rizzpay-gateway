# RizzPay Database Architecture

## Overview

RizzPay implements a robust and scalable database architecture that ensures data integrity, security, and high performance across all payment operations. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, redundancy for critical operations, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables

#### 1. Merchants
- Stores merchant account details with appropriate KYC information
- Includes business details, contact information, and verification status
- Referenced by most other tables in the system

#### 2. Transactions
- Central table for all payment transactions
- Stores comprehensive payment details, status tracking, and audit information
- Uses JSON columns for flexible payment details storage
- Indexed for high-performance querying by date ranges, merchant, and status

#### 3. Wallets
- Maintains merchant wallet balances
- Tracks deposits, withdrawals, and settlement operations
- Implements double-entry accounting principles for financial accuracy

#### 4. Payment_Methods
- Configures available payment methods for each merchant
- Stores commission rates, transaction limits, and feature flags
- Controls which payment options are available to merchants

#### 5. API_Keys
- Manages merchant API credentials
- Includes scope limitations and usage tracking
- Enforces security policies and access controls

#### 6. Webhooks
- Stores webhook configuration for real-time notifications
- Includes endpoint URLs, authentication details, and event subscriptions
- Tracks webhook delivery status and retries

### Transaction Ledger Design

The transaction ledger uses a double-entry bookkeeping system where each financial transaction affects at least two accounts:

1. **Double-Entry System**:
   - Each transaction creates a debit in one account and a credit in another
   - Total debits always equal total credits, ensuring data integrity
   - Prevents accounting errors and simplifies auditing

2. **Ledger Table Structure**:
   - `ledger_entries` table with transaction references
   - Records both sides of every transaction
   - Maintains running balances for quick reporting
   - Uses transaction isolation for consistency

3. **Transaction Types**:
   - Payment capture (customer → merchant escrow)
   - Settlement (escrow → merchant wallet)
   - Withdrawal (merchant wallet → bank account)
   - Refund (merchant wallet → customer)
   - Fee collection (merchant wallet → RizzPay revenue)

### Data Partitioning

For high-volume operations, data is partitioned by:

1. **Time-based Partitioning**:
   - Transaction tables partitioned by month
   - Optimizes query performance for recent transactions
   - Simplifies archiving of historical data

2. **Merchant-based Sharding**:
   - Large merchants may have dedicated database shards
   - Isolates high-volume traffic from affecting other merchants
   - Scales horizontally for unlimited growth

## Security Implementation

### Row-Level Security

- RLS policies restrict merchant access to only their own data
- Administrators have controlled access based on role assignments
- API requests automatically filtered by merchant context

### Data Encryption

- PII data encrypted at the column level
- Transaction details encrypted at rest
- API keys and secrets stored using secure hashing

### Audit Logging

- All database modifications logged with before/after values
- User identity and timestamp recorded for every change
- Tamper-evident design for regulatory compliance

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

1. **Replication Strategy**:
   - Primary database with multiple read replicas
   - Automatic failover to maintain availability
   - Geographic distribution for disaster resilience

2. **Backup Procedures**:
   - Full database backups daily
   - Incremental backups hourly
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - 90-day retention policy

3. **Recovery Time Objectives**:
   - RTO: < 5 minutes for failover
   - RPO: < 1 minute data loss maximum

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Optimized indexes for common query patterns
   - Partial indexes for filtered queries
   - Expression indexes for complex conditions

2. **Materialized Views**:
   - Pre-calculated aggregates for reporting
   - Scheduled refreshes during low-traffic periods
   - Optimized for dashboard performance

3. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Efficient connection management
   - Application-level connection distribution
   - Dynamic scaling based on load patterns

## Database Migration Strategy

1. **Versioned Migrations**:
   - Sequential, immutable migration files
   - Forward and rollback capabilities
   - Automated testing before deployment

2. **Zero-Downtime Updates**:
   - Compatible schema updates without interruption
   - Gradual feature adoption patterns
   - Blue-green deployment capability

## Conclusion

RizzPay's database architecture is designed for scale, security, and reliability. By implementing financial industry best practices and modern database techniques, the system provides a solid foundation for processing high volumes of payment transactions securely and efficiently.
