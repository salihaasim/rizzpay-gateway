npm run terraform:plan:prod
npm run terraform:apply:prod
```

### Step 3: Import Data to AWS RDS
```bash
# Set environment variables for target database
export DB_HOST="your_rds_endpoint"
export DB_USER="rizzpay_admin"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
export DB_NAME="rizzpay"

# Import data
npm run import:data test
npm run import:data uat
npm run import:data prod
```

## Phase 2: Application Migration

- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings
- [ ] Update database connection strings
- [ ] Configure external API keys

### Step 6: Deploy Applications
```bash

npm run deploy:uat

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline

### Step 7: Set up GitHub Actions
- [ ] Create deployment workflows

- [ ] Backup and recovery testing

## Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios
- [ ] Prepare emergency contacts
- [ ] Create communication plan

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Optimize costs
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Train team on new infrastructure
- [ ] Decommission old resources (after validation period)

## Important Notes
